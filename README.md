# fb-groups-sharer
Share a post,link,picture in your facebook groups by one click.
It uses a proxy site to post on facebook incase your server is blocked by facebook ...

##WTF !!
A noob , primitive web App , but it works !! :D
I created it for a friend, a while ago , and i found it when i was checking the server's files ..
 

##Usage
just upload it in your hosting or a free hosting 
then go to the main page complete the empty inputs
and make sure the 'uploads' folder has a write permission .. 


##Logging
the script automatically logs all what happens in a file 'log.txt'
if you didn't create the file and gave it write permission you may face an error..
